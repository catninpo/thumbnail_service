# Thumbnail Service
A basic image thumbnail service written in Rust. Tutorial guided from the Ardan Labs Rust Fundamentals course with minor implementation changes (for example migrating from 0.6 to 0.7 axum).
Main goals of the project are to help familiarise myself with basic Rust syntax and common tasks such as interacting with a web server and database.
